    <p>Youth Unlimited (abbreviated YU, formerly known as the American Federation of Reformed Young Men's Societies,[2]
        the Young Calvinist League, and then the Young Calvinist Federation)[3] is a youth ministry in Canada and
        the United States that was formed in September 1919.[2] The organization has its roots in the Christian Reformed
        Church in North America,[4] but partners with other Christian denominations.[5] Youth Unlimited is one of three youth
        ministries under the Dynamic Youth Ministries umbrella organization, the other two being GEMS Girls' Clubs and the
        Calvinist Cadet Corps.[6] In August 1950, the organization, which was then called the Young Calvinist Federation (YCF),
        released a report calling for the institution of educational programs and legislative programmes in order to afford African Americans
        "rights and opportunities equal to those enjoyed by other members of society."[7] The American Federation of Reformed Young Women's Societies,
        which was founded in May 1932, merged into the YCF in December 1955.[2] In August 1967, the YCF held an international convention in Edmonton,
        Alberta.[8] From December 30, 1982 until January 2, 1983, the YCF co-sponsored a conference with members of local churches in Calgary.
        [9] The name of the organization changed to Youth Unlimited (YU) in 1992.[2] In 1998, the Ellensburg, Washington chapter of the
        organization spent three days removing graffiti from various parts of the city.[10] In Toronto, Ontario, YU volunteers and staff work
        to help transition women out of prostitution.[11]</p>
